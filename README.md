# Matt Raible's Live Templates

These are the [IntelliJ IDEA Live Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html) that I've used in many demos and screencasts over the years. I'll document them someday.

See [sharing live templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-live-templates.html) to see how to import these templates or export your own.
