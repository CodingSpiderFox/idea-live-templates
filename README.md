# Matt Raible's Live Templates

These are the [IntelliJ IDEA Live Templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html) that I've used in many demos and screencasts over the years. 

See [sharing live templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-live-templates.html) to see how to import these templates or export your own.

[Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) today. It's a spectacular IDEA for Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript, S/CSS, and HTML!
